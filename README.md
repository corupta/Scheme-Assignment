# Scheme-Assignment
### A scheme assignment for analyzing a list of travelers and locations

## Project Details
That's a project I've created as a university homework for the course, CMPE 260 - Principles of Programming Languages on May 7th, 2018.

What the project is about can be found via [Project.pdf](https://github.com/corupta/Scheme-Assigment/blob/master/Project.pdf)

## How to Use

Open the traveler_solution.rkt file with DrRacket or any other Scheme IDE.

Create LOCATIONS and TRAVELERS lists in the format:
(One example is the data inside the 'travelerdb.rkt' file, you can just copy & paste it.)
(Another example is the commented data in the 'traveler_solution.rkt' file.)
* `(<location> <accommodation-cost> (<neighbor-location1> ... <neighbor-locationN>) (<activ-
ity1> ... <activityN>))`
* `(<traveler> (<city1> ... <cityN>) (<activity1> ... <activityN>) <home>)`
  
(Check out the commented LOCATIONS and TRAVELERS list and create something similar.)

Then, just run the project and you can use all the operations defined in the [Project.pdf](https://github.com/corupta/Scheme-Assigment/blob/master/Project.pdf)
